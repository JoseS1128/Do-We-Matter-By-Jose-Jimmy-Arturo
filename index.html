      <h2 class="statement">Inevitably our world will die. Humans will probably not make it till that time. However we shall attempt to break that belief. The best way to accomplish this is to one day abandon the planet we call home and expand into the outer universe. For now, we will cover the known solar system</h2>

    <h2 class="mercuryInfo">Mercury's extreme temperatures and lack of an atmosphere would make it very difficult, if not impossible, for people to live on the planet. ... With its extreme temperature fluctuations, Mercury is not likely a planet that humans would ever want to colonize.</h2>
    
    <h2 class="venusInfo">The planet's defining surface characteristic, however, is its flat, smooth plains, which cover about two-thirds of Venus — these plains would, arguably, be the best places to set up a home base to live. Venus' gravity is almost 91 percent of Earth's, so you could jump a little higher and objects would feel a bit lighter on Venus, compared with Earth. "You probably wouldn't notice the difference in gravity so much, but what you would notice is the dense atmosphere," Svedhem said. "The air is so thick that if try to move your arm quickly, you would feel resistance. It would almost be like being in water."
</h2>
    
    <h2 class="earthInfo">Earth has been our home for thousands of years. It has provided for us all this time but one day we will exhaust mother earth. This will come soon since the world is starting to become more overpopulated and the demand for resources is increasing. Earth has been our home but soon we will have to abandon it. We will have to look deep into space to find a new home.
</h2>
    
    <h2 class="marsInfo">If you were to live in the northern hemisphere, you'd enjoy about seven months of spring, six months of summer, a little more than five months of fall and only about four months of winter. (A year on Mars is about 1.88 Earth years, and a day lasts a little more than 24 hours.). Turning this into our home won’t be hard. First thing we are going to have to plant plants to get an oxygen rich atmosphere. Then water will start and at this point we have already succeeded. The mars storms will be gone and all we have to do is start building homes and cities.
</h2>
     
    <h2 class="jupiterInfo">As we all know Jupiter is a gaseous gas giant and it has a large mass, almost twice the sum of all other planets in the Solar system. So, if it happens that we go to Jupiter and as we know it does not have a hard surface, we could not stand on it. So what would happen if we dived into it? Would we will float on the surface (I don't think so), or would we be crushed into pieces due to gravity pull dragging us to the center of the planet with its whole mass above us?</h2>
    
    <h2 class="saturnInfo">If you are a warm weather person, or looking for a balmy place to retire, you could build your home in Saturn’s interior. However, be forewarned that temperatures are likely able to soar as high as 21,000º Fahrenheit. Even though Saturn is a frozen world, sitting 887 million miles from the Sun, its core is scorching hot. In fact, Saturn spits out double to heat it takes in from the Sun.Instead, it will be much more appealing to live on the outer regions of Saturn. Using proper technology, you will want to have a well-protected dome structure that can float in the ringed planet’s upper atmosphere. Up here, atmospheric pressure can drop to quasi-Earth-like levels and prove much more ideal. Although, ideal may not be the most fitting term, as your atmosphere is now made mostly of ammonia ice. Now that you have selected a location, let’s review your new routine. </h2>
     
    <h2 class="uranusInfo">If life did exist on ice giant Uranus, it wouldn’t be the life that we’re used to. The fact that this giant planet is made mostly of ices, has no solid surface and has an atmosphere with a freezing temperature of -224 degrees Celsius (-371 degrees Fahrenheit), along with a core heated up to 4,700 degrees Celsius (8,492 degrees Fahrenheit), makes it a very inhospitable place to live for any complex life.

It’s very unlikely that life exists on Uranus. Not only because of the aforementioned characteristics of this planet, but also because of the intense pressures that would crush life. In addition, it has been noted that there’s no process to supply organisms with energy
</h2>
      
    <h2 class="neptuneInfo">Now, similar to living on other planets in the outer solar system, your new planet has no solid surface. Therefore, living on Neptune will require constructing a bubble-like dome in the upper atmosphere. But, the dome will require tremendous strength to shelter you from deadly winds.
Wind and Chills encompass all Neptune regions. But, the northern parts are slightly more favorable. Our only close encounter of Neptune happened with Voyager 2 in 1989. Despite the few missions, data indicates the southern region is home to the most extreme weather.
